## **Abstract** 
This study we compare the Cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Bitcoin over a Twelve-month period. The data analysis compared both digital currency’s using comparisons in volume of change, price fluctuations, and weekday to weekend pricing. 
Additionally, the use of major world events was also viewed to see cause-effect relation to crypto pricing. In this study, correlation was found with pricing and in volume, with pricing having a correlation result of 0.6701 and volume being 0.6234 
showing both crypto currencies had a significant correlation with each other. Weekday and weekend were shown to have a drop in price during weekends and an increase in price during weekdays. While major world events were only shown to have a slight
effect on pricing changes.

## **Introduction**
The use of cryptocurrency is prevalent in today’s society. More now than ever the use of trading of digital currency is constantly used and continues to grow, and for that reason understanding the market trends and effects becomes important [1]. 
With learning about the data analysis of cryptocurrencies, information can be taken about how price trends are affected, giving a better view on investment options in the finical sense. Things like when to invest, what may be best to invest and future options will be explored in this paper. 
Having a better grasp of this information can lead to better financial decisions and creating better informed decisions when investing in digital currencies and, hopefully, give the reader the best chance at creating financial success.  To dive into this topic, an understanding of both Cryptocurrency and the technology behind it, Blockchain, is needed for better perception of this research. 
To begin, Blockchain itself is the use of decentralized database shared among networks that store information digitally. Blockchain has a high privacy usage and encryption technology [2] 
which has been used in the new creation of cryptocurrencies in today’s digital markets. Cryptocurrencies themselves are derivative of the blockchain technology, using what blockchain used to create its privacy in the form of "hashes". These hashes are special as they cannot be copied, removed, or altered in any way. Because of this, they become the perfect 
tool for trade as it covers the security risk other forms of technology may have. Cryptocurrency, while not only being secure and private, is also not backed by any government, and is instead backed independently by the users who trade it, this creates a freer market where the currency is safer from hyperinflation. This data analysis will cover two of the most traded Cryptocurrency’s today, that being Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) [3]. 
The analysis was conducted by answering several questions on the bases of taking the pricing and volume of each of these cryptocurrencies over a year period then collecting/analyzing this data on excel graphs and sheets. These graphs helped us answer several questions, that being our price and volume fluctuating at the same pattern, what are the pricings for weekdays and weekends, and do major world events effect trading?
This paper will answer these questions revealing market trends within cryptocurrency today.

## **Methods & Materials**
Data was collected online using a public commercial domain website of "Yahoo Finance" where information over a Twelve-month period starting with November 1st ending with October 1st was downloaded for the two independent variables used.
Ethereum and Bitcoin as the main Cryptocurrency, in order to test the effect of these two variables a full factorial experiment was designed for the variables.
Two factors were identified for the use of this experiment, namely Pricing change of currency and the volume fluctuation over time.
Data of these factors were collected as shown in figure 1

in excel spreadsheet when downloaded.
For each date during the twelve-month period each price and volume was listed individually. 
Three sets of graphs were created from this data using excel software for data organization and graph making for both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC); pricing as a dependent variable (in USD) and date in months for the dependent variable. A line graph was made and can be seen in figure 2 in results. For Volume, the exact method is used like in pricing, with volume replacing the independent variable of pricing instead. A line graph was then created distributing the data over the twelve-month period. Lastly, A bar graph is used to compare the data of weekends vs weekday pricing of both cryptocurrencies separately. 
The equation for average was used by combining all days of weekdays and all days of weekends together and dividing by the total. This bar graph is the same for both Ethereum and Bitcoin with pricing being independent and week faction being dependent for the variable.
